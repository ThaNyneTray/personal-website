      <description>1. About Asserts  assert - if the expression returns true, it passes and continues. If not, it fails. assert &amp;quot;add some message&amp;quot; - it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good idea to add a message next to the insert assert some_val == some_other_val - makes sense to compare reality against what is expected.  use assert_equal some_val, some_other_val instead. you can also have more than 2 values here. assert_equal some_val, other_val, again_val... is valid   assert_match(/ /, &amp;quot;.</description>
