<h1>1. What This Book Is About and How to Read It</h1>
<div id="problems-vs-exercises." class="section level2">
<h2>1.1 Problems vs Exercises.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercises</strong> are questions that one can solve immediately, mostly by applying specific techniques to it. The main point is that for exercises, not much thought on the approach is needed.</li>
<li><strong>Problems</strong>, on the other hand, require more thought and resourcefulness in order to resolve.</li>
<li>From what I gather, what is a <em>problem</em> to me can appear to be a trivial <em>exercise</em> for the more advanced problem solver.</li>
<li>The experienced problem solver solves problems on three levels
<ul>
<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Mathematical and psychological ideas for starting and pursuing problems.</li>
<li><strong>Tactics:</strong> Diverse mathematical methods that work in many different settings.</li>
<li><strong>Tools:</strong> Narrowly focused techniques and “tips” for specific situations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-three-levels-of-problem-solving" class="section level2">
<h2>1.2 The Three Levels of Problem Solving</h2>
<div id="lessons-from-the-mountaineering-analogy" class="section level3">
<h3>Lessons from the Mountaineering Analogy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Usually, you can’t use <em>tools</em> as summaries of your problem solving. Rather, the <em>strategic</em> and sometimes <em>tactical</em> ideas are often described in your summary of your problem solving.</li>
<li>During problem solving, we’re bound to encounter obstacles. Some of these are just exercises, but some of them present a real challenge.</li>
<li>Such an obstacle is called a <strong>key obstacle</strong>, and negotiating this key obstacle is called the <strong>crux move</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="from-mountaineering-to-math" class="section level3">
<h3>From Mountaineering to Math</h3>
<p>When approaching a problem, you must begin a process of <strong>investigation</strong>. I could just try anything that comes to mind, but as a beginner, I should cultivate a more organized approach</p>
<ul>
<li>First, think strategically - don’t try to solve the problem, but think about it on a less focused level
<ul>
<li>The goal is to come up with an approach that may barely have mathematical content but that “improves” our situation rather than necessarily solving the problem.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strategies help us start to solve a problem. But they remain just vague outlines of what needs to be done.</li>
<li>The concrete tasks are done at the lower level of tactics and tools.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="lessons-from-the-example-1.2.1" class="section level3">
<h3>Lessons from the example 1.2.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is on page 4 (21)</li>
<li>The first step when encountering a problem is to <strong>orient yourself</strong> to the statement of the problem. Problems usually come in 2 flavors:
<ul>
<li>Those that ask you to <strong>prove</strong> something.</li>
<li>Those that ask you to <strong>find</strong> something.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In proof problems we want to first formulate the <strong>hypothesis</strong> (what is given) and the <strong>conclusion</strong> (what we want to prove)</li>
<li><strong>Strategy 1:</strong> we might want to focus on the conclusion and ask this - what would we need to prove that would immediately lead to the conclusion of the problem?
<ul>
<li>This is called looking at the <strong>penultimate step</strong></li>
<li>If we can’t think of an easy criteria for determining the penultimate step, then we might want to try a different strategy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Strategy 2:</strong> Get your hands dirty. Try out some examples/plug in some numbers.
<ul>
<li>If we notice a pattern, we can then create some <strong>conjecture</strong>.</li>
<li>Our new strategy would then be to prove that conjecture.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To prove the conjecture we can make use of various tactics and tools. Those used in this problem include
<ul>
<li>Tactics - use of <strong>factorization</strong> and <strong>symmetry</strong></li>
<li>Tool - recognizing a common factorization, specifically the <strong>difference of 2 squares</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other such tools and tactics could be
<ul>
<li>Tactics - <strong>substitution</strong></li>
<li>Tools - the method of <strong>undetermined coefficients</strong> (look this up)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="a-problem-sampler" class="section level2">
<h2>A Problem Sampler</h2>
<ul>
<li>Problems are divided into 3 large families: <strong>recreational</strong>, <strong>contest</strong>, or <strong>open-ended</strong>.</li>
<li>In each family, we have problems <strong>to find</strong> and problems <strong>to prove</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Problems to find ask for a specific piece of info</li>
<li>Problems to prove require a more general argument.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Recreational Problems</strong> - a.k.a “brain teasers” - they require little formal mathematics, but instead rely on creative use of basic strategic principles</li>
<li><strong>Contest Problems</strong> - usually problems written for formal exams with time limits, often requiring special tools and/or ingenuity to solve. They can be very challenging</li>
<li><strong>Open-ended Problems</strong> - mathematical problems that are sometimes vaguely worded and that may have no actual solution.
<ul>
<li>They can be very exciting to work on, and a lot of times, partial solutions are all you can get.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="strategies-for-investigating-problems" class="section level1">
<h1>2. Strategies for Investigating Problems</h1>
<ul>
<li>First, we start with some <strong>psychological strategies</strong> that will help me rapidly improve my ability to <em>work at a problem</em>.</li>
<li>Then, we examine some strategies to help me <strong>begin investigations</strong>.</li>
<li>The solution to any problem involves the <strong>investigation</strong>, in which you orient yourself and discover what is going on, and the <strong>argument</strong> in which you convince others of your solution. This chapter also examines the more common methods of formal argument.</li>
</ul>
<div id="psychological-strategies" class="section level2">
<h2>2.1 Psychological Strategies</h2>
<div id="mental-toughness-lessons-from-polyas-mouse" class="section level3">
<h3>Mental Toughness: Lessons from Polya’s Mouse</h3>
<ul>
<li>In problem solving, we must try and try again and <em>vary our trials</em> in order to not miss the favorable possibilites that might be initially hidden from us.</li>
<li>At the same time, an important part of problem solving is understanding when to give up. It is ok to give up on a problem, at least temporarily</li>
<li>Maybe I give up too soon because I lack the <strong>mental toughness</strong> attributes of <strong>confidence</strong> and <strong>concentration</strong>
<ul>
<li>It is difficult to keep at a problem when I don’t think I can solve it</li>
<li>It’s also impossible to keep working beyond my “frustration threshold”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To build up confidence &amp; concentration, I have to start working on easy problems, i.e. those that I can solve after expending a modest amount of effort.</li>
<li>By gradually increasing the intellectual load, I can also simultaneously increase my <em>frustration threshold</em></li>
</ul>
<div id="example-2.1.1" class="section level4">
<h4>Example 2.1.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Page 15 (32)</li>
<li>The moral of the story is to resist the urge to immediately declare a hard problem impossible.</li>
<li>Strategy: <strong>Make the problem easier strategy:</strong> this strategy involves <strong>wishful thinking</strong> - if the given problem is too hard, solve an easier one</li>
<li>Tool: <strong>topological equivalence</strong> - get back to this one.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="creativity" class="section level3">
<h3>Creativity</h3>
<ul>
<li>The good problem solver is highly open and receptive to ideas that are floating around in plain view that might not be easy to see</li>
<li>The trick here is to remain confident in the face of a beautiful, creative solution
<ul>
<li>Don’t think, “I could never come up with this.”</li>
<li>Rather think, “Beautiful solution! Let’s put it to work”</li>
<li><em>Learn to shamelessly appropriate new ideas and make them my own</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Always be on the lookout for new ideas; master them and use them in many different places.</li>
<li>Every problem I encounter should be analyzed for its “novel idea” content as well.</li>
<li>One way to heighten my perceptiveness is to stay “loose”.
<ul>
<li>At the start, try to look for ideas at the periphery</li>
<li>Be on the lookout for turns and twists</li>
<li>Don’t get locked onto one method</li>
<li>Try to consciously break or bend the rules</li>
</ul></li>
