i am watching  my fan base shrink to thirds,130,Kamikaze,1,The Ringer,2018-08-31
and i was just trying  to do the right thing  but word,131,Kamikaze,1,The Ringer,2018-08-31
has the court of public opinion reached a verdict,132,Kamikaze,1,The Ringer,2018-08-31
or still yet to be determined ,133,Kamikaze,1,The Ringer,2018-08-31
 cause i am determined to be me  critiqued or worshipped,134,Kamikaze,1,The Ringer,2018-08-31

tried to two time me,61,Kamikaze,5,Normal,2018-08-31
and throw it up in her face  til i dry heave,62,Kamikaze,5,Normal,2018-08-31
how could i be so naive ,63,Kamikaze,5,Normal,2018-08-31

yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah,2,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
it 2002  everything was totally new,3,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
we were globally huge  watching  sales go through the roof,4,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
we wrote and we feuded  runyon avenue soldiers included,5,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
a multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse,6,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
we were so bulletproof wrote  souped and soaked in our youth,7,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
thought we was running  shit  til we lost the sole of our shoe,8,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
the death of doody broke us in two,9,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
we were thrown for a loop  aint none of us know what to do,10,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
and at the time i was going  through my own struggles too,11,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
so i was not in no condition to be coaching  us through,12,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
everyone tried to go solo  really nobody blew,13,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i was hoping  they do  so i aint have to shoulder the crew,14,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
the plan was put everyone in position so that they knew,15,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
how to stand on their own  and i do not want to open up wounds,16,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth,17,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
 cause the truth is  the moment that proof died  so did the group,18,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
shoot ,19,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
if i could leave this all behind,20,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line,21,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
down to the river with you,22,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31

i forgot to make amends,26,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
to all the friends i may have hurt,27,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i better stop and say my grace,28,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
from it i pray that i do not fall,29,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
 cause on the way back down i may,30,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
end up running  back into them all,31,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones,32,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
it was never the same  and it bothered me since,33,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
and the farther we drift apart  the more awkward it gets,34,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
the more time goes by  the more life happens,35,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
and we gotta be men  we got responsibilities,36,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
plus we do not say how we feel,37,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
and i feel like this is what got us in the debacle we are in,38,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
been with you guys thick and thin,39,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
but it almost as if sometimes we are not even friends,40,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
which reminded me  biz   rockstar  was the shit,41,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
you all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit,42,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
if you woulda put d12 on it  wish i coulda did,43,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
more than try talking  you into coming  up off of it,44,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i know it was not my fault  but part of it probably is,45,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i think of all of the trips to bet,46,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
and the rappers i wish that we woulda politicked with,47,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
maybe you all coulda clicked and got you some features,48,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
but that water under the bridge,49,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
but i am washing  my sins in it  til my conscience is cleansed,50,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
if i could leave this all behind,51,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line,52,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
down to the river with you,53,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
help me leave this all behind,54,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i ama wash away my sins,55,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i ama rinse away this dirt,56,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i forgot to make amends,57,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
to all the friends i may have hurt,58,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i better stop and say my grace,59,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
from it i pray that i do not fall,60,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
 cause on the way back down i may,61,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
end up running  back into them all,62,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones,63,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
bacardi and hen   never thought the party would end,64,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
one minute you are bodying  shit  but then your audience splits,65,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
you can already sense the climate is starting  to shift,66,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
to these kids you no longer exist,67,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
went from raining  cats and dogs in this bitch,68,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
to tiny drops  little drips,69,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
and by the time your reign is over  you will hardly be missed,70,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
you start thinking  of all the artists you dissed,71,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
all the carnage you left  is this the kind of karma you get,72,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
for turning  your fucking  back on bizzy  kuniva and swift ,73,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
a freudian slip  subconsciously  i honestly wished,74,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i aint feel so much guilt and you all did not harbor resentment,75,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
but it hard to pretend that you all aint got none,76,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i just wish i had words  but i guess there just are none for this,77,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
to my partners  i cannot say how sorry i am,78,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
this is not how i planned for our story to end,79,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i love all of you men,80,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
but i just cannot be the guy everybody depends,81,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
on for entire careers  cause that not even fair,82,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i will always be here  but that spark is not there,83,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
and i do not know how to recapture that time and that era,84,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i have tried hearkening back to  but i am fighting  for air,85,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i am barely charting  myself,86,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
feels like i am on the descent  but it was not my intent,87,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
to treat you all like a stepping stone,88,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
though i aint left no one behind  but we been down every road,89,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
done all we possibly can  i know we kept our hopes up,90,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
but the longer we spend living  this lie that we live,91,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
the less is left for closure  so let let this go,92,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
it not goodbye to our friendship  but d12 is over,93,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i ama wash away my sins,94,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i ama rinse away this dirt,95,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31
i forgot to make amends,96,Kamikaze,7,Stepping Stone,2018-08-31

is more than twice than a black life span,64,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15
i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner,65,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15
i feel like checking out on life  cannot escape this circumstance,66,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15

as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter,74,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15
we fight back with violence but acts like that are,75,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15
black eyes on the movement,76,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15
which makes black lives madder,77,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15
at cops and cops madder,78,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15
that why it at a stalemate,79,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15

and that racism  the fear that a black face gives them,90,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15
a subconscious racist,91,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15
wait  why are there black neighborhoods ,92,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15

the poverty that we face so the crime rate s the highest in,102,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15
the lowest classes  it like a razor wire fence,103,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15

or be  capped in america  like steve rogers,119,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15
 cause no one oversees these cops and,120,Revival,4,Untouchable,2017-12-15

a great dad  but a bad husband,98,Revival,10,Bad Husband,2017-12-15
all my life  i was told  i was never nothing special,1,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
i do not need to be reminded of it every other second,2,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
pecially when all my self esteem,3,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
already shot to hell  i am falling helplessly,4,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
i am embarrassed  i don t want no one else to see,5,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15

but makes life a living hell for me,9,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
she does that thing with her lip  now she melting me,10,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
i am putty in her palms  i m wrapped around her finger,11,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
a yo yo on a string  she lets me sit there and just dangle,12,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
until something better comes along,13,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
and she will just drop me like a hot potato,14,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
i look like i am in pain  but i am okay though,15,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
 cause i know she loves me my friends  what do they know ,16,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
in my moments of weakness,17,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
i openly admit the shit i would not normally,18,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
i am extremely self conscious and enormously,19,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me,20,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
it only turns to ammunition for her in this war  when she,21,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
gets going  she do not stop  when i am up she like a downer,22,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15

she do not want me  she just do not want to see me with someone else,34,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
the idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself,35,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15
to see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her health,36,Revival,11,Tragic Endings,2017-12-15

never asked to be rich  all i did was wish,139,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
i had a dime for every time that i was doubted,140,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
but then i think about it  then i am enraged,141,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
 cause i just figured out that if i was paid,142,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
for the time i spent to put the pen to the page,143,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
it would be minimum wage  minimum wage ,144,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
but it embedded in my head i never,145,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
hunted for the bread and butter,146,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
what i wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but,147,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
i am never going to get the credit for the sweat and blood,148,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
i put up in the pen  and when i am dead i wonder,149,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
will they put me on a pedestal,150,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
or forget i was ever this incredible ,151,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
i guess i better go harder than ever  cause,152,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
i will never get another motherfucking  opportunity again,153,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
to offend as many people with this  i can simply because i can,154,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
 cause nobody likes me  everybody hates me,155,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
they want me to go eat some worms  i hope you offended ,156,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
and drag my name through the mud  through the dirt,157,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
but i ama make you eat your words  i hope you offended ,158,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
you can try to hold me down  but you better let me up,159,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
 cause you are only going to make things worse  i hope you offended ,160,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
 cause i swear when i get up  i am never going to let up,161,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
 til everybody eats my turds,162,Revival,15,Offended,2017-12-15
some nights i want to run for the hills,1,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
it never easy with you,2,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
i cannot reason with you,3,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
but your smile is as rare as it comes,4,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
what would i do without that ,5,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
maybe that why i come back,6,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
oh  what i would not do for you ,7,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
starting  to think we were made for each other,8,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
but one of us in this relationship is raising  the other,9,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
you remind me of my mother,10,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
we drive one another crazy as each other,11,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
and we are both adults  so there no excuse,12,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
for the games that we play with each other,13,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
where you at  at a friend  no  you aint  mothafucker ,14,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
but i give her the benefit of the doubt,15,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
whenever the doubt kicks in  shiver when i touch her,16,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
 cause i love her so much  i am a sucker,17,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
how her bottom lip can quiver when she in trouble,18,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
she in hot water  think i caught her cheating  again,19,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
give her another chance  another one after that ,20,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
i am swimming  in that egyptian river   cause i am in denial,21,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
say i do not eat shit  but i got a shit eating  grin when i smile,22,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
making  an excuse for us to act it out,23,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
she just acting  out with her inner child,24,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
then i set the truth on fire,25,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
 cause i would rather believe a lie,26,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
then i breathe a sigh of relief  i do not believe in,27,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
going  to bed mad  i keep on tryin ,28,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
to make a bad girl good,29,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
but have not i stood by you in good times ,30,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
and bad  i am starting  to feel like your goddamn dad,31,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
 cause i literally feel like you could die if ever should i,32,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
leave you for good and never would i,33,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
it would be all bad  never understood why they call it goodbye,34,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
but i think i am a pretty damn good guy,35,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
and you are a good person too,36,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
i can save you  i can make you change,37,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
but i keep putting  my fucking  foot in my mouth,38,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
every time i gotta come and bail you out,39,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15

and i am in trouble  but i cannot leave  i will sell you out,41,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
i could never turn my fucking  back on you what is that ,42,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
i am co dependent  i am just now noticing  it,43,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
but somehow it like every time i am about to go to end it,44,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
i aint got the cojones to do it  nor the heart,45,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
our apartment tore apart,46,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
you are using  my heart for a dartboard,47,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
but god must have aligned stars for us,48,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
 cause somebody paired us up,49,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
and they say he aint capable of making  a mistake,50,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
but this one perfect   cause i am ,51,Revival,16,Need Me,2017-12-15
i am packing  up my shit  as much shit in the car as i can fit,1,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
and i am just driving  as far as i can get,2,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
away from these problems  til all of my sorrows i forget,3,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15

i try to look alive but there nothing  like holdin ,9,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
your head up high when you are dead inside and i just hide  so in,10,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
case you are wondering  why are my insides showin ,11,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
 cause i done spilled all my guts and those are mine  so i am,12,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
picking  them up and stuffing  them back,13,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15

recovery brought me nothing  but back,15,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
to right where i was and perhaps,16,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
this coulda been my victory lap  if i was not on the verge of relapse,17,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
it seems to be the reoccurring main theme,18,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
the shit i would daydream as a kid  i was eighteen,19,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
i went from an irate teenager to still raging,20,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
as an adult  amazing  back then i put anything,21,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
into the rhyme  whether it was sad  mad  happy or angry,22,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
i spit it  the mainstream  i hit it,23,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
yay me  i did it   did what ,24,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15

percent of what i rapped about,26,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
maybe i shoulda did a better job at separating,27,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
shady and entertaining from real life,28,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
but this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain,29,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
it the craziest shit i,30,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
ever seen  and back then it was like i aint even,31,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
bothered taking into consideration,32,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
you one day being older and may hear me say things,33,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
i didn t  a  mean and  b  just ain t me,34,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
okay  so ladies and gentlemen,35,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15

feel like a lame piece of shit  i sound cranky and bitter,37,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
complain  beef and bicker  bout the same things,38,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
 cause when i look at me  i do not see what they see,39,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
i feel ashamed  greedy,40,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
and lately i have been contemplating,41,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me,42,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15
it making me crazy  what in my ,43,Revival,17,In Your Head,2017-12-15

nurses lean over the bed  pulling tubes out,53,Revival,19,Arose,2017-12-15
then the sheet over my head  shut the room down,54,Revival,19,Arose,2017-12-15

so my shoulders carried the weight of the load,26,The Marshall Mathers LP2,15,Headlights,2013-11-05
then nate got taken away by the state at eight years old,27,The Marshall Mathers LP2,15,Headlights,2013-11-05
and that when i realized you were sick,28,The Marshall Mathers LP2,15,Headlights,2013-11-05
and it was not fixable or changeable,29,The Marshall Mathers LP2,15,Headlights,2013-11-05
and to this day we remain estranged  and i hate it though  but ,30,The Marshall Mathers LP2,15,Headlights,2013-11-05
 cause to this day we remain estranged  and i hate it though,31,The Marshall Mathers LP2,15,Headlights,2013-11-05

your world is torn in half  you wake in its wake to start the,9,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
mourning process  and rebuilding  you are still a work in progress,10,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
today a whole new chapter  it like an enormous ass  uh,11,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
thunderstorm has passed ya  you weathered it,12,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
and poked its eye out with the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses,13,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
stopped to inhale  cannot even tell your nose is,14,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
stuffed  so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal,15,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
and hit the corner faster  more assertive  never looking back,16,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
may hit the curb  but every day is a new learning curve as you,17,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
steer through life  sometimes you might not want to swerve  but you have to,18,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
to avert a disaster  lucky no permanent damage,19,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
 cause they hurt you so bad it like they murdered your ass,20,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
and threw dirt on your casket but you have returned from the ashes,21,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
and that hurt that you have  you just converted to gasoline,22,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
and while you are burning the past standing at inferno and chant,23,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
you are so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like,24,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
it happens all the time  they take your heart and steal your life,25,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
and it as though you feel you have died  cause you have been killed inside,26,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
but yet you are still alive  which means you will survive,27,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
although today you may weep  cause you are weak,28,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
and everything seems so bleak and hopeless  the light that you are seekin ,29,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
it begins to seep in  that the only thing keepin ,30,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
you from leaping  off the mothafreaking  deep end,31,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
and i am pulling  for you to push through this feeling,32,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
and with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow,33,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
you may even feel so good that you are willing to forgive them,34,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
even after all the shit you been put through  this feeling of resilience is building,35,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
and the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building,36,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
you are sealed in  but you are fireproof  flame retardant  you withstood it,37,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
and as you climb up to the roof  you are just chillin   you look down,38,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
 cause you are so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling,39,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
as time passes  things change every day,40,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
but wounds  wounds heal  but scars still remaining the same,41,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
but tomorrow  today going down in flames,42,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05

so feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even,44,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
perspire from the heat  exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief,45,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
and as you say goodbye to the grief it like watching the walls,46,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
melt in your prison cell  but you have extinguished this living  hell,47,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
still  a little piece of you dies as you scream ,48,The Marshall Mathers LP2,21,Beautiful Pain,2013-11-05
