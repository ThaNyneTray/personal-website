### Introduction  
I happen to be a huge Eminem fan, so his recent tweets highlighting the anniversary of his [Relapse](https://twitter.com/Eminem/status/1261345913777336320) albums and organizing a Spotify listening party for his prolific [The Marshall Mathers LP](https://twitter.com/Eminem/status/1264232431554646016) got me rightfully excited. Being relatively new to text mining, I decided to dive into and explore his lyrics as a means to learn and apply various text mining techniques. This post is the first of a two-part analysis; stay tuned for the second one. The two posts will cover:

1. **Text Mining and Exploratory Analysis**

2. **Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling**

### Pre-requisites  
I will make heavy use of the dplyr [@dplyr], tidytext [@tidytext], an ggplot2 [@ggplot2] in this analysis. In particular, my introduction to text mining was through the book [Tidy Text Mining](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) by [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob) and [Julia Silge's](https://twitter.com/juliasilge) book. It's a free resource that covers text mining, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. Seeing as you are reading this post, you likely have interest in the subject, so I encourage you to read through this. In addition, I took a lot of inspiration from Debbie Liske's [post](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/R-nlp-machine-learning) on DataCamp, which is a must-read.

### 1. Library Imports  
First, we import the libraries we'll need for this analysis. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)  # for data manipulation, transformation, plotting
library(tidytext)   # text mining package that handles tidy text data
library(geniusr)    # interfaces with Genius API to get lyrics
library(Rspotify)   # interfaces with Spotify API to get album tracklist
library(wordcloud2) # visualizing wordclouds, letterclouds
library(lubridate)  # handling date type data
```
### 2. Data Collection
For this, I used a combination of two packages. First, I used the Rspotify [@Rspotify] package to get Eminem's album list and then got a tracklist and lyrics for each album using the geniusr [@geniusr] package; these packages interface with the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/) and [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/) respectively. I used the  The Spotify API here for two reasons. The Genius API package does not currently have a method for retrieving an artist's album list. In addition, the Spotify API offers various musical features for each song in the Spotify database, which could be useful in any potential predictive analysis I perform, especially when used in conjunction with lyrics data. Therefore, I would like to maintain a consistent dataset of songs.    
You can find the code for data collection [here](https://github.com/desmond-tuiyot/Eminem_Lyrics_Analysis/blob/master/rcode/analysis.R) if you are interested. I saved the lyrics dataset [here]("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/desmond-tuiyot/Eminem_Lyrics_Analysis/master/data/original_lyrics.csv"), which we import below.

```{r}
original_lyrics<-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/desmond-tuiyot/Eminem_Lyrics_Analysis/master/data/original_lyrics.csv")
glimpse(original_lyrics)
```

We have `9` variables and `16,523`. The observations here represent individual lines in for each song in Eminem's discrography. Importantly, the dataset is not currently in tidy text format. As described in the book [Tidy Text Mining](https://www.tidytextmining.com/), tidy text data format is such that each *variable* has its own column, and each *token* has its own row. A token here is a meaningful unit of text; in this analysis, we use a single word as a token.

### 3. Data Cleaning
We want to perform some basic data cleaning before moving on to analysis. Data cleaning is not necessarily a straightforward process. There are some standard pre-processing steps for text data, like changing case, stemming, lemmatization, and so on. On the other hand, some of the pre-processing steps I perform below came about after some data exploration.  
The steps I took in pre-processing are:  
1. Filtering out non-Eminem lyrics  
2. Converting the lyrics to lowercase  
3. Expanding contractions  
4. Removing any non-alphanumeric characters  
5. Filtering out any skits/intros/interludes    
6. Lemmatization  

We first copy the original dataset into a new data frame, in case we need the original later in the analysis. We also change the `album` variable to a factor.
```{r}
lyrics<-original_lyrics
lyrics$album<-as.factor(lyrics$album)
```

#### Filtering out non-Eminem lyrics {#filtering_non_eminem}  
Since we are doing an analysis on Eminem lyrics, we remove any lyrics performed by other artists. These are guest features performing intros, outros, choruses, hooks, or verses. This process is made easy since the lyrics data returned by the geniusr package also includes a `section_name` and `section_artist` variable. These are based on how [Genius](https://genius.com/) labels song sections. Importantly, the `section_artist` for the song `Arose` is wrong, so we have to handle it separately from the other songs. The code for this process is shown below:
```{r}
# Filter out lines whose section artists do not include Eminem
lyrics<-original_lyrics %>%
  filter(str_detect(section_artist, "Eminem")|
         section_artist=="Arose"|
         section_artist=="Castle Extended") %>%
  rename(lyric=line, track_n=track_number) %>%
  group_by(song_name) %>%
  mutate(line=cumsum(song_name==song_name)) %>%
  select(lyric, line, album, track_n, song_name, album_year) %>%
  ungroup()
```

#### Fixing contractions {#expand_contractions}
Contractions are commonplace in lyrics, so we have to expand as many as we can find. I define a function `fix_contractions` that replaces various contractions with their expanded forms. These include common contractions in English as well as some special ones I found after exploring the data. 
```{r}
# first change to lowercase to for consistency
lyrics$lyric<-tolower(lyrics$lyric)

# this is a function to fix contractions. These are contractions I identified
# after exploring the data for some time.
fix_contractions<-function(dat){
  # as in the article, this could be a possesive or is/has
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "'s", "")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "'m", " am")
  # this one could be had or would, but I decide to replace with would
  # barring analysis of tense, which I don't intend to do, this probably has no effect
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "'d", " would")
  # special cases of the n't contraction - won't and can't
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "can't", "cannot")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "won't", "will not")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "don'tchu", "don't you")
  # ain't is a special case.
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "ain't", "aint")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "n't", " not")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "'re", " are")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "'ve", " have")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "'ll", " will")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "y'all", "you all")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "e'ry", "every")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "'da", " would have")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "a'ight", "all right")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "prob'ly", "probably")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "'em", "them")
  # gerund contractions
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "in'\\s", "ing  ")
  # finna, wanna, gonna
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "gonna", "going to")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "finna", "going to")
  dat<-str_replace_all(dat, "wanna", "want to")
  dat
}
lyrics$lyric<-fix_contractions(lyrics$lyric)
```

#### Removing alphanumeric characters
Here we want to make sure that we drop any punctuation marks or any other special characters. For this analysis, we want to focus on only text.
```{r}
# remove alphanumeric characters
lyrics$lyric <- str_replace_all(lyrics$lyric, "[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]", " ")
```

#### Filtering out any skits/intros/interludes. 
Here we filter out any shorter Eminem verses, which turn out to be mostly skits, intros, outros, and interludes. 
```{r}
# removeing skits, intros, outros, interludes
line_count<-lyrics %>%
  group_by(album, song_name) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(n)

short_titles<-subset(line_count, n<15)$song_name

lyrics<-lyrics%>%
  filter(!str_detect(song_name, "Skit"),
         !str_detect(song_name, "skit"),
         !song_name %in% short_titles)
```

#### Lemmatization
Lemmatization is the process of resolving words to their dictionary form. For example, any words in their gerund form (e.g. rapping) will be reduced to their dictionary form (rap). Skipping this process might affect the results of our analysis.
```{r}
lyrics<-lyrics %>%
  mutate(lyric=textstem::lemmatize_strings(lyric))
lyrics
```

<!-- 
#### Lines vs No of Words? 
Fewer lyrics might suggest that Eminem has less of a contribution overall, but it's misleading. If he raps faster, then he definitely fits more words per line. Let's explore this.  

##### number of lines in each song, grouped by album
```{r}
line_counts<-lyrics %>% 
  count(album, song_name) %>%
  arrange(-n)
```

##### number of words in each song, grouped by album
```{r}
word_counts<-lyrics %>%
  count(album, song_name, wt=str_length(lyric)) %>%
  arrange(-n)
```

##### Plot these
```{r}
line_counts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=album, y=n, color=album))+
  geom_point(show.legend=FALSE, size=4)+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw() 

```
```{r}
word_counts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=album, y=n, color=album))+
  geom_point(show.legend=FALSE, size=4)+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw() 
```

```{r}
word_line_df<-line_counts %>%
  inner_join(word_counts, by=c("song_name", "album")) %>%
  rename(total_lines = n.x, total_words = n.y)

word_line_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=total_lines, y=total_words)) +
  geom_point(size=1) +
  theme_bw()

```
More lines meant more words. I'm defaeted
-->
### 4. Analysis

#### Word Frequencies
Depending on the analysis, there might be additional cleaning steps we might want to take. We often find that words such as `a`, `an`, `the`, and `I`, among others, are common across many documents in natural language data and are used with very high frequency. These are called **stop words** and they offer little insight into describing or classifying documents; therefore, they often removed prior to certain types of analysis. In the case of analyzing word frequencies, we want to remove stop words from our data set. 
The tidytext [@tidytext] package offers a set of stop words that we can import and use. First, we use `unnest_tokens` to convert our data frame to tidy text format; recall that the original data set had each line occupying a row. This function converts this so that each word occupies its on row. Next we remove stop words using an `anti_join` operation. The code is as below:
```{r}
data("stop_words")

lyrics_filtered<-lyrics %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, lyric) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  ungroup()

words_total<-lyrics_filtered %>%
  count(word) %>%
  arrange(-n)

words_total
```

To no one's surprise, Eminem curses a lot. His most used words are `fuck` and `shit`, and at number 4 we have `bitch` as well. This might generate interesting insights in case we compare it to other rappers. But on its own, I doubt its usefulness. There are other 'non-useful words' that I have identified through manual exploration of the data set. Throughout any analysis, you will have to deal with uncertainty and make micro decisions like this along the way. It is possible that removing these words will affect other parts of the analysis significantly. For now, we remove these words. 

```{r}
unnecessary_words <- c("fuck", "ah", "yeah", "aint", "shit","ass", "la", 
                       "yah", "ah", "bitch", "ama", "ha", "yo", "ah", "cum",
                       "dick", "ho", "erra", "gotta", "tryna", "gon", "dum",
                       "uh", "hey", "whoa", "til", "chka", "ta", "tahh")

lyrics_filtered <- lyrics_filtered %>%
  filter(!word %in% unnecessary_words)

words_total<-lyrics_filtered %>%
  count(word) %>%
  arrange(-n)

words_total
```

Eminem uses the words `love` and `feel` frequently, so we get the idea that some major topics in Eminem's songs are about love, emotions, and maybe relationships. Eminem has had many songs about relationships, although in most of them he portrays himself as being involved in a somewhat dysfunctional relationship. (See [Love The Way You Lie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uelHwf8o7_U) and [Good Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-TkrWpO75k)). Eminem also uses `shady` frequently, so he is more likely to talks about his supposedly evil and unhinged alter-ego, Slim Shady.  
We might be interested in the differences in word frequency across albums. Here we want to look at proportions, since absolute frequencies can lead to misleading conclusions.

```{r }
freq<-lyrics_filtered %>%
  count(album, word) %>%
  group_by(album) %>%
  mutate(total=sum(n)) %>%
  mutate(freq=n/total) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(-freq)

top10_freq<-freq %>%
  group_by(album) %>%
  top_n(8, freq) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(album, freq) %>%
  mutate(row = row_number())
```
```{r fig.align="center", fig.height=8}
top10_freq %>%
  ggplot(aes(row, freq, fill=album)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~album, ncol=3, scales="free") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=top10_freq$row, 
                     labels=top10_freq$word) + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()
```

Here are some things we can note from this graph:  

* Many of the frequently occurring words in these albums are simply those repeated in hooks and choruses. For example, in the album `Recovery`, we have `cold` and `blow`, which most likely comes from the song `Cold Wind Blows`. In the album `The Eminem Show`, we have `goodbye`, `hollywood` from `Say Goodbye Hollywood` and `superman` from, well, `Superman`. 
* Time is a re-occuring theme. At this moment, however, I cannot say anything definitive about its significance.  
* His first 2 albums feature a lot of use of `slim` and `shady`, which makes sense as this was when he introduced himself and his `alter-ego` to the world. It could also be as a result of the words being repeated in choruses some songs in the albums.
* Notice the lack of *Hailie*, his daughter, or *Kim*, his wife. One of the major reoccuring themes in Eminem's music has been his love for his daughter and his hate for his wife. Contrary to my expectations, these words do not appear among the most frequently used words. 
* Another major theme which lacks representation in the above graph is drugs. A probable reason for this is that Eminem namedrops many different drugs across his discography, which means that the word count for this theme is distributed across many different words. 

##### **Aside:** Hailie, Kim, and Drugs
As an aside, we can check how often he mentions `Hailie` and `Kim`below.
```{r}
words_total %>%
  filter(word %in% c("hailie", "kim"))
```

To explore the drug theme a little more, I got a list of all the drugs that eminem has mentioned in his career from a post by user *Sas* in [this forum post](https://forum.sectioneighty.com/every-prescription-drug-eminem-ever-mentioned.t29686). Granted these are mentions from songs that are not in our data set, because I used his studio albums in this analysis. This list was last updated in 2015; Eminem has released 3 albums since then. In time, I will compile a list for these three newer albums and update this post. For now, we will work with the list below.
```{r}
drugs<-c("Ambie", "Amoxicilline", "Coke", "Crack", "Codeïne", "Hydrocodone",
         "Klonopin", "Lean", "LSD", "Methadone", "Marijuana", "Mollie",
         "Mushrooms", "NoDoz", "Nurofen", "NyQuil", "Percocets", "Purple Haze",
         "Seroquel", "Smack", "Valium", "Vicodin", "Xanax", "Methamphetamine")
drugs<-str_to_lower(drugs)

words_total %>% 
  filter(word %in% c(drugs, "pill", "drug")) %>%
  count(wt=n)
```

Here we combine all the names of the drugs with the words `drug` and `pill` and get the total count, which turns out to be `217`. This displaces `leave` at the number 4 spot, with a count of `212`.

#### Zipf's law 
In simple terms, this law states that given a list of terms from an arbitrary document/book, the frequency of each word is inversely proportional to its rank (rank measured in frequency). That implies that rank 1, the most used word, is used roughly twice as much as the rank 2 word, and 4 times as much as the rank 3 word, et cetera. See [this Wikipedia post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) and [Chapter 3](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tfidf.html#zipfs-law) of Tidy Text Mining for a more in-depth explanation of this law. We can explore this concept with our word count data as well.
First, let's check the distribution of words in our data set. In this case, we stick to the unfiltered lyrics (lyrics with `stop_words` and `unnecessary_words` present).

```{r fig.align='center'}
unfiltered_total<-lyrics %>%
  ungroup() %>% # previously grouped
  unnest_tokens(word, lyric) %>%
  count(word, sort=TRUE)
  
unfiltered_total %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=40, color="black", fill="lightblue")+
  geom_hline(yintercept=0)+
  theme_bw() + xlab("total word count") + ylab("frequency of word count") +
  xlim(0, 50)
```
This distribution is known as the [zeta distribution](https://www.statisticshowto.com/zeta-distribution-zipf/) and comes about as a result of Zipf's law, but it's applications extend beyond modeling the relationship between the rank-frequency of words in natural language.  
To the left of the distribution, we have a few popular words that are used most frequently by Eminem. The long right tail of the distribution in turn shows that there are many words that are used much less frequently.      
A way to test whether a natural language dataset conforms to Zipf's law is to plot a rank-frequency graph, on a log-log scale. In this case, the plotted line should have a negative slope and a linear relationship.
In this case, I want to see if different albums conform to zipfs law

```{r}
albums_total<-lyrics %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, lyric) %>%
  count(album, word, sort=T) %>%
  group_by(album) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(n))

albums_total

# we get frequency by rank
freq_by_rank <- albums_total %>%
  group_by(album) %>%
  mutate(rank = row_number(),
         `term frequency` = n/total)

```
```{r fig.align='center'}
# plot rank-frequency
freq_by_rank %>%
  ggplot(aes(rank, `term frequency`, color=album))+
  geom_line(size=1.1, alpha=0.8, show.legend=FALSE)+
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme_bw()
```
Intuitively, Zipf's law suggests that the frequency of a word decreases rapidly with rank. We see that in this plot as well. The lines have slight curve and show greater deviation towards the its extremes; the relationship is thus not perfectly linear. Regardless, we can see the inverse relationship between the rank of a term and its frequency. 

<!--
#### Word correlation plots 
Since I can only have a bivariate plot as far as correlations go, I wrote a function that takes in 2 album
names and the frequency data frame, and returns a plot. Furthermore, in order to plot these two against each other, I would have to spread the data frame into a wide format - currently, we have `album` as one column, but we want a column for each album. We use `tidyr` spread for that.
```{r}
wide_freq<-freq %>%
  select(album, word, freq) %>%
  spread(album, freq, fill=0)
```

```{r}
albums_corplot<-function(album1, album2, freq){
  album1<-enquo(album1)
  album2<-enquo(album2)
  
  freq<-freq %>%
    select(word, !!album1, !!album2) %>%
    filter(!(!!album1==0) & !(!!album2==0))
  print(album1)
  print(album2)
  ggplot(freq, aes(!!album1, !!album2)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha=0.1, size=2.5, width=0.25, height=0.25)+
    geom_text(aes(label=word), check_overlap=TRUE, vjust=1.5) +
    scale_x_log10(labels=scales::percent_format())+
    scale_y_log10(labels=scales::percent_format())+
    geom_abline(color="red") +
    theme_bw()
}
```
So we can call this function like so
```{r fig.align="center"}
albums_corplot(`The Slim Shady LP`, Revival, wide_freq)
```
Instead of checking all the different albums (we'll have 90 pairwise combinations), we can check pairs which we might find interesting. 

* MMLP2 was meant to be a sequel of sorts to MMLP. We should expect similarities to an extent
```{r fig.align="center"}
albums_corplot(`The Marshall Mathers LP`, `The Marshall Mathers LP2`, wide_freq)

```

* Kamikaze was a response to all the hate Revival
```{r}
albums_corplot(Kamikaze, Revival, wide_freq)
```

Recovery was a sober song, disavowing his drug plagued past. OTOH, Encore was his last album before his hiatus
```{r}
albums_corplot(Recovery, Encore, wide_freq)

```
#### Wordclouds
Wordclouds are a visually appealing way to visualize the relative frequencies of words. One advantage of them is that the most frequent words pop out and are easily noticeable.
```{r}
# let's get a wordcloud for top 300 words
wordcloud2(words_total[1:250,], size=.5)
```
<!--
Let's also try out letter clouds
```{r}
letterCloud(words_total[1:300,], word="EMINEM", size=2)
```
Or maybe not, since nothing's showing up.
-->
#### Word length
Hip hop music places emphasis on a rapper's ability to rhyme. In addition, there is also the basic requirement that the artist should rap on beat. However, Eminem is known to easily pull off multi-syllabic rhymes. The image below shows a section of his song `Stay Wide Awake` where the words he's rhyming are highlighted.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/post/2020-05-23-eminem-lyrics-analysis-nlp_files/rhyme.png">
</p>

Furthermore, he is also able to rap fast, which means he can fit more words into a line and still remain on beat. Therefore, even though longer words are probably harder to rhyme and fit into a line, Eminem is theoretically able to overcome this limitation with ease. 
In any case, words lengths are an interesting measure to explore.
```{r}
word_lengths<-lyrics %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, lyric) %>%
  select(song_name, album, word) %>%
  group_by(song_name, album) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(word_length=nchar(word)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(-word_length)
# summary(word_lengths)
```
```{r fig.align='center'}
# plot it
word_lengths %>%
  count(word_length, sort=TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=word_length, y=n)) +
  geom_col(show.legend=F, fill="lightblue", 
           color="black") +
  xlab("word length") + ylab("word count") +
  ggtitle("word length distribution")+
  theme_bw()
```

The most frequently used words are 3-5 letters long. The distribution has a slightly long right tail and an outlier which is the 28 letter word, `antidisestablishmentarianism`. This analysis would probably be more interesting if we compare Eminem to other artists.  
We can create word clouds based on length to visualize the word lengths. 
<!-- <p align="center"> -->
```{r}
# wordlength word cloud
wl_wc<-word_lengths %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(word, word_length) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  arrange(-word_length)
```
```{r fig.align="center"}
wordcloud2(wl_wc[1:300,],
           size=.15, minSize=.0005,
           ellipticity=0.3, rotateRatio=1,
           fontWeight="bold")
```
<!-- </p> -->

#### Lexical diversity and density
An [article](https://consequenceofsound.net/2014/05/which-rapper-has-the-biggest-vocabulary/), attempted to determine which rapper has the largest vocabulary by counting the number of unique words in the first 35,000 by different artists. I extend this analysis by looking at the number of unique words used by Eminem across his 10 albums (lexical diversity). I also look at the number of unique words divided by the total number of words for each album (lexical density). 
```{r}
lyrics %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, lyric) %>%
  summarise(unique=n_distinct(word))
```
We got 7884 unique words. Remember that our data set only includes lyrics from his studio albums. Let's analyze lexical diversity across his albums.
```{r}
lexical_diversity_per_album<-lyrics %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, lyric) %>%
  group_by(song_name, album, album_year) %>%
  summarize(lex_diversity=n_distinct(word)) %>%
  # mutate(album=reorder(album, album_year)) %>%
  arrange(-lex_diversity) %>%
  ungroup()
```
```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=8}
# lex diversity plot
lexical_diversity_per_album %>%
  ggplot(aes(album_year, lex_diversity)) +
  geom_point(color="red", size=4, alpha=.4) +
  stat_smooth(color="black", se=TRUE, method="lm") +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=album_year, y=lex_diversity), se=FALSE, color="blue", lwd=2) +
  ggtitle("Lexical diversity") +
  ylab("") + xlab("") +
  theme_bw()
```
There's a slight increase in lexical diversity across album time. Surprisingly, his latest album, Music To Be Murdered By, has a lower lexical diversity than his previous two. MMLP2, Kamikaze, and Revival have the highest lexical diversities.  

To contrast, we can also explore lexical density.
```{r}
## LEXICAL DENSITY
lexical_density_per_album <- lyrics %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, lyric) %>%
  group_by(song_name, album, album_year) %>%
  summarize(lex_density=n_distinct(word)/n()) %>%

lexical_density_per_album

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=8}
# plot 
lexical_density_per_album %>%
  ggplot(aes(album_year, lex_density)) +
  geom_point(color="green", alpha=0.4, size=4, position="jitter") +
  stat_smooth(color="black", se=FALSE, method="lm") +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, color="blue", lwd=2) +
  ggtitle("Lexical density") + xlab("") + ylab("") +
  theme_bw()
```
Here we see an increase in lexical density over time, indicating a decrease in repetition with each new album he puts out.

#### tf-idf
Here we use tidytext's `bind_tf_idf` function in a neat way to find the tf-idf for each of these words - tf-idf is a measure of how important a word is to a particular document. If a word is used frequently across all albums, then it's not indicative of or significant to any particular album. But if a word is used in only one album relatively frequently, then we can think of this word as of significance to that album.
```{r}
lyrics_tf_idf <- lyrics %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, lyric) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  count(album, word, sort=TRUE) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, album, n) %>%
  arrange(-tf_idf)

# plot the top tf-idf
top_tf_idf <- lyrics_tf_idf %>%
  arrange(-tf_idf) %>%
  mutate(word = factor(word, levels = rev(unique(word)))) %>%
  group_by(album) %>%
  slice(seq_len(8)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(album, tf_idf) %>%
  mutate(row=row_number())
```
```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=8}
top_tf_idf %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=row, y=tf_idf, fill=album)) +
  geom_col(show.legend=FALSE) +
  labs(x=NULL, y="TF-IDF") +
  ggtitle("Most important words using tf-idf by album") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~album, scales="free", ncol=3) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=top_tf_idf$row,
                     labels=top_tf_idf$word) +
  coord_flip()
```
We can get some insights if we compare this to the word frequency plot we did earlier; I have placed it here again for ease of comparison.
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=8}
top10_freq %>%
  ggplot(aes(row, freq, fill=album)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~album, ncol=4, scales="free") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=top10_freq$row, 
                     labels=top10_freq$word) + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw()
```
Recall that in that plot, the words `feel`, `time`, and `love` appeared frequently in almost all of the albums. Therefore, these words cannot be used to distinguish between albums. On the other hand, the words `goodbye`, `hollywood`, and `superman` which we saw corresponded to specific songs also have appear in the set of words with the highest tf-idf's. These terms are indicative of particular songs, which then helps distinguish albums from each other. Many of the top tf-idf terms correspond to song titles that are also repeated in choruses and hooks. To some extent, we can get a sense of the topics of songs included in each particular album.

#### Comparing word usage
Here I'm trying to find out which albums show up in which albums. We do this using log odds ratio. We wrap that process in a function.

```{r}
get_log_odds<-function(dat, album1, album2){
  album1<-enquo(album1)
  album2<-enquo(album2)
  
  word_ratios<-dat %>%
    count(word, album) %>%
    group_by(word) %>%
    filter(sum(n)>10) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    spread(album, n, fill=0) %>%
    mutate_if(is.numeric, list(~(. + 1)/(sum(.)+1))) %>%
    mutate(logratio=log(!!album1/!!album2)) %>%
    arrange(desc(logratio)) %>%
    select(word, !!album1, !!album2, logratio)
  
  word_ratios
}

word_ratios<-get_log_odds(lyrics_filtered, `The Marshall Mathers LP`, `The Marshall Mathers LP2`)
```

```{r}
plot_log_odds<-function(word_ratios, album1, album2){
  # album1<-enquo(album1)
  # album2<-enquo(album2)
  
  word_ratios %>%
    group_by(logratio<0) %>%
    top_n(15, abs(logratio)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(word = reorder(word, logratio)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(word, logratio, fill=logratio<0)) +
    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
    coord_flip() + theme_bw() +
    ylab(paste0("log odds ratio (", album1,"/", album2,")" )) +
    scale_fill_discrete(name="", labels=c(album1, album2))
}
```

```{r}
plot_log_odds<-function(word_ratios, album1, album2){
  # album1<-enquo(album1)
  # album2<-enquo(album2)
  
  word_ratios %>%
    group_by(logratio<0) %>%
    top_n(15, abs(logratio)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    mutate(word = reorder(word, logratio)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(word, logratio, fill=logratio<0)) +
    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
    coord_flip() + theme_bw() +
    ylab(paste0("log odds ratio (", album1,"/", album2,")" )) +
    scale_fill_discrete(name="", labels=c(album1, album2))
}
```
```{r fig.align="center"}
plot_log_odds(word_ratios, "The Marshall Mathers LP", "The Marshall Mathers LP2")
```

### Conclusion
In this article, I have explored Eminem's lyrics by looking at word frequencies, rank-frequency distributions, word lengths, lexical diversity, and lexical density. I will post the next article soon, which will cover sentiment analysis and topic modeling of Eminem's lyrics. Many of the observations we've made here will be useful in that context as well.  
Let me know what you think in the comments.
